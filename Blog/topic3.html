  <!-- <p>Hello Devs, we are in the first week of 2022 now, and many of you might have already made your goals about what to learn in 2022, but if you haven't, then you have come to the right place. </p>

<p>Earlier, I have shared roadmaps to become a <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/10/the-java-developer-roadmap.html">Java developer</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/the-2018-devops-roadmap-31588d8670cb">DevOps Engineer</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/the-2019-react-js-developer-roadmap-9a8e290b8a56">React Developer</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/the-2019-web-developer-roadmap-ab89ac3c380e">Web Developer</a> and in this article, I share some of the best frameworks and libraries for web development, mobile app development, and big data, which an application developer can learn in 2022. </p>

<p>This New Year will be all about <a href="https://javinpaul.medium.com/10-frameworks-and-libraries-mobile-application-developers-can-learn-in-2020-e0b91391cade">Mobile App Development</a>, <a href="https://www.java67.com/2021/12/top-5-courses-to-learn-blockchain.html">Blockchain</a>, <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/07/top-5-online-courses-to-learn-cloud-computing-aws.html">Cloud Computing</a>. </p>

<p>Machine learning, and next-generation web with a greater focus on big data technologies like <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/04/top-5-hadoop-courses-to-learn-online.html">Hadoop</a> and <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2021/11/top-5-courses-to-learn-apache-spark-in.html">Spark</a>.</p>

<p>But you can still learn the popular Java and Web development frameworks like <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/10/the-2018-react-developer-roadmap.html">React</a>, <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/01/top-5-nodejs-and-express-js-online-courses-for-web-developers.html">Node.js</a>, <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/06/5-best-courses-to-learn-spring-boot-in.html">Spring Boot</a> to take your career to the next level. These frameworks are tried and tested and will be here for at least the next 5 years to come.</p>

<p>I have always believed in full-stack development, which means a Programmer should know both front-end and back-end technologies. Now it also includes mobile development technologies like <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2017/12/top-5-android-online-training-courses-for-Java-developers.html">Android</a> or <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/11/5-free-ios-app-development-courses-for.html">iOS</a>.</p>

<p>My simple advice for a Java programmer is to learn Android while for the <a href="https://medium.com/@javinpaul/top-10-courses-to-learn-c-for-beginners-best-and-free-4afc262a544e">C++ programmer</a> is to iOS so that you can create your own apps, do some freelancing and improve your chances of getting a job in the lucrative <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/01/10-things-mobile-app-developers-can-learn.html">mobile app development</a> sector.</p>

    technologies always breaks the shackles.</p>

  <h3>
    <a name="1-spring-boot" href="#1-spring-boot">
    </a>
    <strong>1. Spring Boot</strong>
  </h3>

  <p>Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based Applications that you can "just
    run." Spring Boot takes an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started
    with minimum fuss. </p>

  <p>If you are a Java developer working on web development, then I strongly suggest you learn Spring Boot in 2022.</p>

  <p>Another good news to share with you guys is that NetBeans has added support for Spring Boot, so it's now easier to
    learn and develop Java web applications using Spring Boot 2. 0.</p>

  <p>If you decide to learn Spring Boot in 2022, then <strong><a

  <h3>
    <a name="2-reactjs" href="#2-reactjs">
    </a>
    <strong>2. React.js</strong>
  </h3>

  <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's declarative: React uses a declarative paradigm
    that makes it easier to reason about your application.</p>

  <p>It's efficient: React computes the minimal set of changes necessary to keep your DOM up-to-date. And it's flexible:
    React works with the libraries and frameworks.</p>

  <p>In short, A declarative, dynamic, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. If you decide to

  <h3>
    <a name="3-nodejs" href="#3-nodejs">
    </a>
    <strong>3. Node.js</strong>
  </h3>

  <p>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to write a server-side
    application in JavaScript. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and
    efficient.</p>

  <p>If you learn Node.js and React, then you can write a client-server application in just one programming language,
    JavaScript.</p>

  <p>If you decide to learn Node.js in 2022, I suggest checking out <a

  <h3>
    <a name="4-angular" href="#4-angular">
    </a>
    <strong>4. Angular</strong>
  </h3>

  <p>Angular is an open-source JavaScript framework, maintained by Google, that assists with running single-page
    applications. Its goal is to augment web-based applications with model--view--controller (MVC) capability, to make
    both development and testing easier.</p>

  <p>It's very different from its predecessor Angular JS, which is outdated now, but learning Angular 2 or Angular 8 is
    still a great idea in 2022.</p>

  <p>If you decide to learn Angular in 2022, I suggest you first check the <a
      href="https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Fangular-fundamentals"><strong>Angular:
        Getting Started</strong></a> course from Pluralsight, one of the best courses.</p>

        alt="How to learn Angular" loading="lazy" width="399" height="246"></a></p>

  <p>By the way, you would need Pluralsight membership access to this course, which costs around $29 per month or $299
    annually (14% discount).</p>

  <p>If you don't have Pluralsight membership, I encourage you to get one because it allows you to access their 5000+
    online courses on all the latest topics like front-end and back-development, machine learning, etc.</p>

  <p>It's more like Netflix for Software Developers, and Since learning is an integral part of our job, Pluralsight
    membership is a great way to stay ahead of your competition.</p>

  <p>They also provide a <a
      href="http://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Flearn"><strong>10-day

    <strong>5. TensorFlow</strong>
  </h3>

  <p>Suppose you are curious about Artificial intelligence, Data Science, and Machine learning. In that case, I am sure
    you have heard about TensorFlow, Google's machine learning API, which they have used to develop the RankBrain
    algorithm for Google Search.\</p>

  <p>TensorFlow is one of the most popular machine learning APIs which allows you to automate several real-world tasks,
    for example, you can use it for image detection. </p>

  <p>In fact, a Japanese farmer turned programmer used it to detect the best quality Cucumber, which only his father and
    mother can do with his years of experience.</p>

  <p>That's the power of machine learning, which is now available to everyone because of TensorFlow. It's a good idea to
    learn cutting-edge technology like Machine learning in 2022, and there is no better library to start with than
    TensorFlow.</p>

    means you can release faster, fix bugs easily and it would be lot easier to manage then having separate codebase for
    different platforms. </p>

  <p>In other words, Flutter and React Native are alternative of each other, one uses Dart and other uses JavaScript as
    programming language. </p>

  <p>Update: Earlier, I had included Xamarin, another platform from Microsoft's owned and quickly become famous for
    creating mobile apps for <a

  <p>If you already know one of that C languages and looking for a career in mobile app development then you can learn
    Xamarin but Flutter and React Native are better choice. </p>

    <strong>10. React Native</strong>
  </h3>

  <p>This is another mobile application development framework based upon JavaScript and the popular React framework.
    <strong>React Native</strong> is an extension of <a
      href="http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-react-courses-for-web-developers.html">React</a>, a popular JavaScript
    framework to develop web applications, which allows you to build native Android and iOs apps in JavaScript.</p>

  <p>Unlike Ionic and Cordova, which promotes write once run everywhere but doesn't offer you to create a native app,
    React Native does convert your code into native code, especially for GUI.</p>

  <p>This is a massive advantage for any JavaScript developer who wants to write the mobile application he has always
    dreamed about.</p>

  <p>React Native along with Redux is becoming increasingly popular and turned out to be a valuable skill for your
    resume if you are looking for a job in the mobile app development space as well</p>

  <p>If you decided to learn React Native in 2022, then **<a
